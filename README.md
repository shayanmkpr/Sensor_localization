# Distributed Optimization for Sensor Placement

This repository implements a **distributed optimization framework** for optimal sensor placement in a 2D space. The project explores various algorithms, including **strongly connected networks**, **periodically connected networks**, and the **gossip algorithm**. The goal is to minimize a cost function under specific constraints while ensuring effective collaboration between sensors.

## Problem Description

### Objective
Optimize the positions of **N sensors** to accurately cover **5 points** in a 2D space by minimizing a cost function while satisfying the following constraints:
1. **Coverage Constraint**: Each point must be covered by at least 3 sensors.
2. **Threshold Constraint**: The distance between each sensor and the covered point must not exceed a threshold.
3. **Binary Sensor Activity**: Each sensor can either be active (`1`) or inactive (`0`).

---

## Mathematical Formulation

### Distance Calculation
The Euclidean distance between sensor \(k\) and point \(i\) is:
$$
\text{Distance}_{ik} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_k)^2 + (y_i - y_k)^2}
$$

### Cost Function
The cost function \(J\) is defined as:
$$
J = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{-\sqrt{(x_i - x_k)^2 + (y_i - y_k)^2}}
$$
The goal is to minimize \(J\).

### Constraints
#### 1. Coverage Constraint
Each point \(i\) must be covered by at least 3 sensors:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{N} \text{BinaryVar}_{ik} \geq 3
$$
where \( \text{BinaryVar}_{ik} = 1 \) if sensor \(k\) covers point \(i\), otherwise \(0\).

#### 2. Threshold Distance Constraint
Ensure the distance between sensor \(k\) and point \(i\) is within the threshold:
$$
\text{Distance}_{ik} \leq \text{Threshold}, \; \forall i, k
$$

#### 3. Binary Sensor Activity
Each sensor is either active or inactive:
$$
\text{SensorVar}_k \in \{0, 1\}
$$

## Algorithm Overview

### Steps for Distributed Optimization

#### 1. **Initialization**
- Randomly initialize each sensor's position in a 2D space.
- Create a **strongly connected network graph** to represent communication between agents.

#### 2. **Distributed Consensus**
For any pair of connected agents \(i\) and \(j\):
- If connected:
$$
\text{AssumedPosition}^{(t+1)}_{ij} = \text{ActualPosition}^{(t)}_i
$$
- Otherwise:
$$
\text{AssumedPosition}^{(t+1)}_{ij} = \text{AssumedPosition}^{(t)}_i
$$

#### 3. **Cost Function Optimization**
Each agent minimizes its local cost function:
$$
J_i = -\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{-\sqrt{(x_i - x_k)^2 + (y_i - y_k)^2}}
$$
Using **gradient descent**, the positions are updated as:
$$
\text{ActualPosition}^{(t+1)}_i = \text{ActualPosition}^{(t)}_i - \gamma \cdot \nabla J_i
$$
where \( \gamma \) is the step size.

#### 4. **Constraint Satisfaction**
If constraints are violated, adjust the positions to the nearest feasible values:
$$
\text{ActualPosition}^{(t+1)}_i = \text{NearestFeasiblePosition}(\text{ActualPosition}^{(t+1)}_i)
$$

#### 5. **Convergence Check**
Repeat steps 2â€“4 until the system converges.

## Periodically Connected Network Graph

### Features
1. **Grid Graph Generation**:
   - Create a 2D grid graph to represent sensor connectivity.
2. **Periodic Connections**:
   - Wrap edges to form a toroidal structure using `periodic=True`.
3. **Adjustable Parameters**:
   - Modify grid size and connection probabilities to balance local and periodic links.

---

## Gossip Algorithm

### Overview
The gossip algorithm facilitates decentralized information exchange to collaboratively optimize sensor positions.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**: Sensors start with random positions.
2. **Network Graph Creation**: Use a periodically connected graph for sensor communication.
3. **Information Exchange**:
   - At each iteration, sensors exchange information (positions, gradients) with random neighbors.
4. **Objective Function Update**:
   - Update local objectives using exchanged data.
5. **Convergence Check**: Monitor changes in the global objective function to determine convergence.
